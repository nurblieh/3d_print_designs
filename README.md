# 3D Printing Designs

## Sous-Vide Case
An OpenSCAD model of a case and lid for my homemade sous-vide device. 

This specific design is unlikely to be useful for anyone else, but may provide as a general example.

I posted a write-up for this project here,

Note that I didn't cover the 3D model details. That may came with a later post.

## screw_lib
A small OpenSCAD library which exposes some critical metric screw dimensions via function calls.

This lib contains a good example of a poor-man's hash/lookup-table in OpenSCAD, which itself is not a feature rich language. 

Feel free to use the lib in its entirety.
