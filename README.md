# 3D Printing Designs

## Sous-Vide Case
An OpenSCAD model of a case and lid for my homemade sous-vide device. 

This specific design is unlikely to be useful for anyone else, but may provide as a general example.

A description of the device's innards are available at my friend's site, http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.14/people/palash_nandy/sous_vide.html .


## screw_lib
A small OpenSCAD library which exposes some critical metric screw dimensions via function calls.

This lib contains a good example of a poor-man's hash/lookup-table in OpenSCAD, which itself is not a feature rich language. 

Feel free to use the lib in its entirety.
